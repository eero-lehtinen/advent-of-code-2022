# Advent of Code 2022

This repository contains my solutions to the [Advent of Code 2022](https://adventofcode.com/2022) challenges.

My motivation for doing this honing my skills in the [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) programming language.

## Running the solutions

Install rustc 1.65 (with [rustup](https://rustup.rs)) although this should work with all later and most earlier versions.

```sh
# Replace '01' with the day you want to run
cargo run -p aoc01 --bin part1 --release
cargo run -p aoc01 --bin part2 --release 
```
